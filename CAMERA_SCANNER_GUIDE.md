# 📷 Camera QR Scanner - How It Works & Troubleshooting

## ✅ Camera Scanner Now Implemented!

I've added a **real camera QR scanner** to your project using the Html5-QRCode library.

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **New Features:**
✅ **Real camera access** - Uses device camera
✅ **Automatic QR detection** - Scans QR codes in real-time
✅ **Table number extraction** - Reads table number from QR code
✅ **Visual feedback** - Shows camera feed and scanning status
✅ **Error handling** - Graceful fallback if camera unavailable

---

## 📱 Why Camera Might Not Work

### **3 Main Reasons:**

### 1. **Security Restrictions (HTTPS Required)**

**Problem:**
- Browsers block camera access on non-secure connections
- `file://` protocol doesn't support camera
- `http://` (non-secure) blocked by most browsers

**Solution:**
- ✅ Use **Live Server** (automatically provides secure connection)
- ✅ Use **HTTPS** when deployed (Netlify/Vercel provide this)
- ✅ `localhost` is trusted (works for testing)

### 2. **Camera Permissions Not Granted**

**Problem:**
- Browser asks for camera permission
- User clicks "Block" or "Deny"
- Camera access is blocked

**Solution:**
- Click the 🔒 lock icon in browser address bar
- Find "Camera" permission
- Change to "Allow"
- Refresh the page
- Try again

### 3. **Device Doesn't Have Camera**

**Problem:**
- Desktop computers without webcam
- Camera is broken/disabled
- Using remote desktop

**Solution:**
- ✅ Use the **table selector dropdown** instead
- Test on phone/tablet with camera
- Use external webcam

### **Table Selector:**
✅ **Best for:** Testing, demos, devices without camera
✅ **Pros:** Always works, no permissions needed
✅ **Cons:** Manual selection required

### **For Your Assignment:**
- **Demo in class:** Use table selector (reliable)
- **Show on phone:** Use camera scanner (impressive!)
- **Lecturer testing:** Both options available

## 🚀 Deployment & Camera

### **Important: HTTPS Requirement**

**Development (Testing):**
- ✅ `http://localhost:5500` - Camera works (trusted)
- ❌ `file:///C:/...` - Camera blocked (security)

**Production (Deployed):**
- ✅ Netlify - Automatic HTTPS - Camera works perfectly
- ✅ Vercel - Automatic HTTPS - Camera works perfectly
- ✅ GitHub Pages - Automatic HTTPS - Camera works perfectly

**After deploying, camera works everywhere!** 🌍

## 🔍 How the QR Scanner Works (Technical)

### **Process Flow:**

1. **User clicks "Start Camera Scanner"**
2. **Browser requests camera permission**
3. **User grants permission**
4. **Camera feed starts** (back camera on phones)
5. **Library scans for QR codes** (10 frames per second)
6. **QR code detected** → Extract URL
7. **Parse table number** from URL (`?table=5`)
8. **Store in localStorage**
9. **Stop camera**
10. **Redirect to menu page**

### **Security:**
- Camera only active when scanning
- Stops immediately after detection
- No recording or data storage
- Privacy-first approach
