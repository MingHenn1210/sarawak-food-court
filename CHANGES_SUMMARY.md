# ‚úÖ Changes Made to Support Public QR Codes

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Before:** QR codes only worked on localhost (your computer only) ‚ùå
**After:** QR codes can work on any public URL for anyone to scan ‚úÖ

---

## üìù Files Modified

### 1. `js/qr-code-manager.js` ‚≠ê MAIN FIX

**Added Configuration Section:**
```javascript
const QR_CONFIG = {
    PRODUCTION_URL: 'http://localhost:5500', // ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATE THIS
    USE_AUTO_DETECT: true
};
```

**Added `getBaseURL()` Method:**
- Automatically detects if running on localhost or production
- Uses production URL when configured
- Smart fallback to current domain if already deployed

**Updated `generateMenuURL()` Method:**
- Now uses `getBaseURL()` instead of hardcoded `window.location.origin`
- Handles both development and production paths correctly

## üöÄ Next Steps for You

### Step 1: Deploy Your Website

Choose a hosting platform:
- **Netlify** (Easiest) - Drag & drop your folder
- **GitHub Pages** (Free) - Push to GitHub
- **Vercel** (Fast) - Connect repository

### Step 2: Update Configuration

Once deployed, update this line in `js/qr-code-manager.js`:

```javascript
PRODUCTION_URL: 'https://your-actual-site.netlify.app', // Your real URL here
```

### Step 3: Regenerate QR Codes

1. Open admin panel: `https://your-site/admin/food-courts.html`
2. For each table, click **"Reset QR Code"** (orange button)
3. New QR codes will use your production URL
4. Download and print them

### Step 4: Test!

1. Scan QR code with your phone
2. Should open your public website
3. Should show correct table number
4. Should allow ordering food

---

## üîç How It Works Now

### Development Mode (localhost)
```
You're on: http://localhost:5500/admin/food-courts.html
QR codes generate URLs pointing to: YOUR_PRODUCTION_URL (if set)
```

### Production Mode (deployed)
```
You're on: https://your-site.netlify.app/admin/food-courts.html  
QR codes generate URLs pointing to: https://your-site.netlify.app
```

### QR Code Flow
```
Customer scans QR ‚Üí 
Opens: https://your-site.netlify.app/customer/home.html?foodcourt=abc&table=5 ‚Üí
Sees Table 5 ‚Üí
Browses food stalls ‚Üí
Orders food ‚Üí
Success! üéâ
```

---

## üé® Visual Example

### Before (Broken for Public Users)
```
QR Code contains: http://localhost:5500/customer/home.html?table=1
                   ‚Üë Only works on your computer!

Customer scans ‚Üí ERROR "Cannot connect to localhost" ‚ùå
```

### After (Works for Everyone)
```
QR Code contains: https://sarawak-food-court.netlify.app/customer/home.html?table=1
                   ‚Üë Public URL - works for everyone!

Customer scans ‚Üí Opens website ‚Üí Can order food! ‚úÖ
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Auto-Detect Mode (Recommended) - Default Setting
```javascript
QR_CONFIG = {
    PRODUCTION_URL: 'https://your-site.netlify.app',
    USE_AUTO_DETECT: true  // Smart detection
};
```
**Behavior:**
- On localhost ‚Üí Uses PRODUCTION_URL if set (for testing production QR codes)
- On production ‚Üí Uses current domain automatically
- Best for most users ‚úÖ

### Manual Mode (Advanced)
```javascript
QR_CONFIG = {
    PRODUCTION_URL: 'https://your-site.netlify.app',
    USE_AUTO_DETECT: false  // Always use PRODUCTION_URL
};
```
**Behavior:**
- Always uses PRODUCTION_URL
- Good for testing production behavior on localhost
- Requires manual switching

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Before printing QR codes:

- [ ] Website deployed to public hosting
- [ ] Updated PRODUCTION_URL in code
- [ ] Re-deployed with updated config
- [ ] Generated new QR code via admin panel
- [ ] Scanned QR code with phone
- [ ] Website opens (not localhost)
- [ ] Correct table number shows
- [ ] Can browse food stalls
- [ ] Can add items to cart
- [ ] Can place order
- [ ] Order appears in hawker dashboard

## üí° Tips

### For Testing During Development

You can test production QR codes even on localhost:
1. Set PRODUCTION_URL to your deployed site
2. Keep USE_AUTO_DETECT: true
3. Generate QR codes on localhost
4. They'll point to production URL
5. Test by scanning with phone

### For Multiple Environments

You can maintain different configs:
```javascript
// Development
PRODUCTION_URL: 'http://localhost:5500'

// Staging
PRODUCTION_URL: 'https://staging.your-site.com'

// Production
PRODUCTION_URL: 'https://your-site.com'
```

## üÜò Common Issues

### "QR code still shows localhost"
- Did you update PRODUCTION_URL?
- Did you regenerate the QR codes?
- Clear browser cache and try again

### "Scanned QR code but got error"
- Is your website actually deployed?
- Test the URL directly in browser first
- Check browser console for errors

### "Database connection error"
- Check Supabase configuration
- Verify API keys are correct
- Ensure Supabase project is active
